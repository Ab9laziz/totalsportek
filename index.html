            <h2>Barcelona, Bayern Munich and the biggest summer transfers around Europe</h2>
            <p>Premier League clubs spent a net total of well over £1bn - and a gross of £1.9bn - during the summer transfer window this time around, outspending all their rival leagues by a massive, and continually unsettling, amount. Some have fared better than others with that business, it’s fair to say.
    
            LaLiga’s £55m net spend was the next highest total outlay, which factors in the likes of Jules Kounde, Umar Sadiq and Brais Mendez moving from one Spanish club to another - so no net addition, as the fee out and in is the same - and big-money sales to the Premier League such as Alexander Isak and Casemiro.</p>

            <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo agreed to join surprise European club before deal fell through</h2>
            <p>The 2022 summer transfer window has officially slammed shut.
    
                It’s been a head-spinning few months which has seen Premier League clubs spend well over £1 billion on the likes of Casemiro, Erling Haaland, Gabriel Jesus, Christian Eriksen and countless others.
                
                And one of the biggest themes that has pervaded these cash-rich weeks has been the fact that more than a few English clubs have paid over the odds to get the player they wanted.
                
                A summer of crazy spending
                You know what we mean, right? We’ve all seen a couple of purchases this summer that have made us go: ‘now, that’s a really, really good signing, but for how much?!’
                
                To an extent, it’s the way of the world and you only have to look at instances such as Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool and Kevin De Bruyne to Manchester City to see that paying more than the player’s market value can be worth every penny in the long run.</p>

        <h2>Antony, Fofana, Casemiro: The most overpriced XI of the summer transfer windowC</h2>
        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was arguably this summer’s biggest transfer saga.

            Although the five-time Ballon d’Or ended up staying with Manchester United, according to recent reports, he came within touching distance of joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce.
            
            That’s according to a recent report from Ajansspor (as relayed by ESPN), who claims the 37-year-old agreed ‘in principle’ to team up with compatriot Jorge Jesus at the Ulker Fenerbahce Sukru Saracoglu Stadium..</p>
